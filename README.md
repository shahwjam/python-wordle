# Wordle Game — Python Implementation 🎯

**Author:** Shahwan A

## Description

This is a terminal-based Python implementation of the popular **Wordle** game.  
The player has **six attempts** to guess a randomly selected **five-letter word**.  

After each guess, the game provides **color-coded feedback**:  

- 🟩 **Green** → Correct letter in correct position  
- 🟨 **Yellow** → Correct letter in wrong position  
- ⬜ **Gray** → Letter not in the word  

The game is simple, interactive, and fun, while also demonstrating Python programming concepts like functions, loops, string manipulation, and random selection.
